**Cite**: [Supervised Topical Key Phrase Extraction of News Stories using Crowdsourcing, Light Filtering and Co-reference Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4886)

**Description**: The 110-PT-BN-KP is a TV Broadcast News (BN) dataset that contains 110 transcription text documents from 8 broadcast news programs from the European Portuguese ALERT BN database ranging from politics, sports, finance and other broadcast news. After the speech to text transcription, each news was manually reexamined to fix any segmentation error and the gold keywords were created asking one tagger to extract all keywords that summarize the document content.

**Cite**: [Keyphrase cloud generation of broadcast news](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4606)

**Description**: 500N-KPCrowd-v1.1 is a broadcast news transcription dataset. This dataset consists of 500 English broadcast news stories from 10 different categories (art and culture; business; crime; fashion; health; politics us; politics world; science; sports; technology) with 50 docs per category. The ground truth is built using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service to recruit and manage taggers. Multiple annotators were required to look at the same news story and assign a set of keywords from the text itself. The final ground truth consists of keywords selected at least by 90% of the taggers.

The dataset is based on a subset of CiteULike.org containing documents that have been indexed with at least three keywords on which at least two users have agreed. As well as filtering the document set, the dataset only considers annotators who have at least two additional co-annotators tagging the same common document. The result is a set of 180 documents indexed by 332 taggers, where most documents are related to the area of bioinformatics.
